= Before Executing any Task =
Before you can actually execute any task using this GUI, you will need to visit [http://code.google.com/p/openbiomind/ OpenBiomind homepage] and download the latest release of the !OpenBiomind {{{jar}}}. You will also need the {{{pipeline.properties}}} file. The easiest way to get this is to download the !OpenBiomind extras available at the same location.

Next, you must set these two files as the {{{Preferences}}} of the !OpenBiomind-GUI ({{{Window > Preferences > OpenBiomind}}}). Now, you are ready to execute the tasks.

Optionally, if you wish the application to automatically convert the [http://www.graphviz.org/ Graphviz] {{{dot}}} files into images, you must separately download and install Graphviz from [http://www.graphviz.org/] and then set the {{{dot}}} utility in the preferences.
